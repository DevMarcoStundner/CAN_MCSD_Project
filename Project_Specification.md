# Project specification 

- This Project aims to implement a communication between two microcontrollers. 

- The communication should be accomplished with two CAN bus transceivers.

- The output will be transmitted to the PC over UART.

- The microcontroller should check for Errors with the following
    
    - Cyclic Redundancy Check
    - Frame Check
    - ACK-Error
    - Monitoring
    - Bit-stuffing
